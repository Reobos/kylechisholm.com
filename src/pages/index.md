I'm interested in robotics and tech, especially human-centered applications like surgical robotics, assistive and rehabilitation robotics, and collaborative robots. A little more info on my work is provided below and you can access [my resume here](./assets/pdf/kyle_chisholm_cv.pdf).

### Kinova

One of my favorite aspects of my work at Kinova is implementing features that might seem straightforward and intuitive but require a deep understanding of the robotics modeling and mathematics that underpin the technology. It's very satisfying to go from user and systems-level requirements to proof-of-concept and finally a deliverable feature. I work on may aspects of robot manipulators at Kinova including trajectory generation, workspace analysis, collision avoidance, hand-guiding, calibration, actuator tuning and characterization. Here are some products I've had the pleasure of working on:

### Ross Video

Trajectory generation is key for beautiful shots and responsive real-time control from camera operators. I learned a lot building out new motion profiles and timescaling with a camera pedestal mobile robot, and it was exciting to be a part of early development for a new robot design, including vision-based collision avoidance. I was also fortunate to work on some experimental features with automated tracking for faces and a proof-of-concept multi-camera horse racing application.

### Research

I love human-robot interaction and I treasure my days as a researcher prototyping a gait rehabilitation device that had a lot of really cool features like 6 DoF haptics force rendering with force and visual feedback, redundancy resolution, and real-time user biomechanics estimation. I also worked on a bunch of side projects and got deep into C/C++ for real-time robotic controls software.
